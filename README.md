***I'm still developing the game. But my main purpose in putting these codes is for you to see how I can code.***

This project is a **Car Game** developed using Unity. The player controls a car that continuously moves forward on a straight road. The goal is to survive as long as possible without crashing while achieving the highest score.  

Features:
Smooth car controls: The player can move the car left and right.  
Speed control: The player can accelerate and decelerate.  
Dynamic traffic system: Various vehicles spawn on the road. 
Endless gameplay: The game continues until the player crashes into another vehicle.

3. **The player must avoid collisions** by carefully maneuvering around traffic.
